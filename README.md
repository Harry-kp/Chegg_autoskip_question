# Aim 
- To automate the process of skipping questions in **chegg expert Q&A** under **"I don't have the subject knowledge"** .
- To gain knowledge about the python module pynput.
- Ofcourse , to feel like you are a computer science student and you know some tweaks and hacks.

# Prerequisite
1. Python 3
2. pynput module version 1.7.1 or higher

# Lets hack this
1. ## Download the script 
   Just clone this directory into your system or you can just copy the content of **autoskip_chegg_question.py** file.
2. ## Changes to be made.
   This script runs fine for the **15.6 inch display** and full browsing screen of browser. You have to change three values in the script according to your display size .
   * skip_button  - Place x,y coordinates according to your display size
   * reason_button - Place x,y coordinates according to your display size
   * submit_button  - Place x,y coordinates according to your display size</br>

   </br>
   **This work can be done using brute force like running script and changing the value everytime cursor doesn't click the required button . I hope this is no issue .**
3. ## Running the script
    Run the script in the terminal and minimize the terminal . Open browser and enter to the Q&A section on expert chegg.
4. ## Controlling the script
   * Right Click - This play/pause the script . Everytime you see a questiom that you can answer right click and start answering .
   * middle mouse button - To stop the script or you can just open the terminal and stop from there .

# Screenshot 
When you start the script in terminal it gives you output in this way</br>
