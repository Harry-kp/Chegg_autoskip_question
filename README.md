# Lets hack this

- ## Changes to be made.

   This script runs fine for the **15.6 inch display** and full browsing screen of browser. You have to change three values in the script according to your display size .
   * skip_button  - Place x,y coordinates according to your display size
   * reason_button - Place x,y coordinates according to your display size
   * submit_button  - Place x,y coordinates according to your display size</br>

   </br>
             **This work can be done using brute force like running script and changing the value everytime cursor doesn't click the required button . I hope this is no issue .**
